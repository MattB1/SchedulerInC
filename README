RUNNING PROGRAM
————————————————

This program has been designed to run using the C language. Compile and run the program by using “./run.sh [your file]”.
For example “./run.sh file.txt” will run the program with the argument file.txt passed as an argument.

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
————————————————
	-	The program will accept a text file in the following format:
	3
	1,0,10
	2,2,1
	3,6,2
	- The first line must be a single integer that will tell the program how many processes will need to be scheduled
	- The subsequent lines will consist of 3 integers separated by commas to indicate the processing id, the processes
	  arrival time, and the time required for the process.
	- The program will then print an output of the processes and how they were scheduled for four different algorithms:
	  First Come First Served, Shortest Remaining Time, Round Robin with a quantum of 2, and with a quantum of 4.
	- Only one file will be accepted at a time.
